## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 – *Programming II*.  
The repository includes various weekly exercises and programming tasks that demonstrate object-oriented programming principles, clean coding practices, and the use of development tools such as Git and PyCharm.

My name is **[Nicksoon]**, a student passionate about learning software development and writing clean, maintainable code.

## Key Lessons About Clean Code

- Use **meaningful variable and function names** to improve readability and maintainability.
- Follow **consistent formatting and indentation** standards across all code files to reduce confusion.
- Break problems into **smaller, reusable functions or classes**, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.
- Write **clear and concise comments** only where necessary – the code itself should be mostly self-explanatory.
- Remove unused code and files to keep the project **clean and easy to navigate**.
